Terraria, but with technology!

Construct multitile machines with the Science Workbench and explore the wonders of technology!

Current Multitiles:
[c/dddd00:Auto-Extractinator]
- consumes [c/dd3333:Terra Flux (TF)] to automatically extractinate silt, slush, fossils and sand
[c/dddd00:Basic Battery]
- stores [c/dd3333:Terra Flux (TF)]
[c/dddd00:Blast Furnace]
- powered by coal, increases the gains from smelting ores
[c/dddd00:Basic Solar Panel]
- generates [c/dd3333:Terra Flux (TF)] based on the time of day and weather
[c/dddd00:Basic Thermal Generator]
- generates [c/dd3333:Terra Flux (TF)] by burning certain organic compounds, such as wood and food items
[c/dddd00:Basic Wind Turbine]
- generates [c/dd3333:Terra Flux (TF)] based on the current wind speed and weather
[c/dddd00:Electrolyzer]
- consumes [c/dd3333:Terra Flux (TF)] to chemically separate certain liquids into their gaseous components
[c/dddd00:Fluid Tank]
- stores one liquid and one gas
[c/dddd00:Greenhouse]
- grows and automatically harvests herbs, mushroom grass, cacti, saplings and pumpkins
[c/dddd00:Item Cache]
- can store a large quantity of a single item and can be locked to only store a certain item
- this machine is useful for making sure only one type of item ends up going into a machine
[c/dddd00:Liquid Duplicator]
- consumes [c/dd3333:Terra Flux (TF)] to duplicate certain liquids
[c/dddd00:Magic Storage Connector]
- allows importing and exporting items from a Magic Storage storage system
[c/dddd00:Matter Energizer]
- consumes [c/dd3333:Terra Flux (TF)] to convert certain items into other items
[c/dddd00:Reinforced Furnace]
- burn wooden items to produce Coal
[c/dddd00:Salt Extractor]
- consumes Water or Saltwater to produce Salt
[c/dddd00:Science Workbench]
- constructs machinery
[c/dddd00:Pulverizer]
- consumes [c/dd3333:Terra Flux (TF)] to crush certain blocks into materials
