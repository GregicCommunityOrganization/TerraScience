Terraria, but with Science!

Construct multitile machines with your trusty Scientist's Hammer and explore the foundations of chemistry and science!


Current Multitiles:
Salt Extractor - provide Water or Saltwater to produce Salt (NaCl) and Water (H₂O)

Science Workbench - construct chemical compounds from their element components

Reinforced Furnace - burn wooden items to produce Carbon (C)

Air Ionizer - has a random chance to collect certain gaseous elements and compounds from the air


TODO List:
Add more machines
Implement the rest of the elements
Implement more compounds
